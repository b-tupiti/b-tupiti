**`Full-stack Web Developer`**

I'm a full-stack developer and a django enthusiast. I learned how to think like a problem-solver from 2016-2019 (software engineering major). Towards the end of 2018, I landed an internship and got introduced to the django web framework. From then on till today, I have been exploring this wonderful world of software development and loving every bit of it.
