**`Semi Full-stack Web Developer | System Administrator`**

I'm a freelance full-stack developer and a technology enthusiast. I learned how to think like a problem-solver from 2016-2019 (software engineering major). Towards the end of 2018, I landed an internship and got introduced to the django web framework. I say semi full-stack, particularly because I have not built an app (I have, just halfsies) with any front-end tech such as React or Vue. I built fullstack apps with the django framework, but as you know, thats kind of old school now. In comes REST APIs for a more decoupled architecture.

Ultimately, the goal for 2023 is to decouple some of my personal django apps; templates to react apps, and urls to endpoints. That sounds like the opposite of monolithic. sweet! May the code be with you.
