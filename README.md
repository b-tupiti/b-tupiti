**`Full-stack Web Developer`**

I'm a full-stack developer and a django enthusiast. I learned how to think like a problem-solver from 2016-2019 (software engineering major). Towards the end of 2018, I landed an internship and got introduced to the django web framework. From then on till today, I have been exploring this wonderful world of software/web development and loving every bit of it. 

A typical workflow for me would be to design the UI\UX in figma, build out the front-end with frontend libraries (bootstrap, bulma, etc) or use custom css and javascript, and then use the templates in my django application. I usually deploy my apps on django containers and always loved automating the CI/CD process through pipelines (such as github actions). 

Currently, I am learning react, and I will then start building apps with it so that I can incorporate it with the django Rest Framework.
